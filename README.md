# JSS-with-LLMs
Job-shop-scheduling with Large language models

The study focuses on different methods for generating JSP problem formulations using LLMs. 
* Method1: Problem formulation using a large pre-trained LLM (GPT4) with zero-shot example 
* Method2: Problem formulation using a large pre-trained LLM (GPT4) and one-shot example from training dataset. 
* Method3: Problem formulation using a large pre-trained LLM (GPT4) with few-shot examples selected dynamically with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and similarity search. 
* Method4: Problem formulation using a small pre-trained LLM (Google gemma-2B) fin-tunned on the training dataset.
